# NMS-Project

This is a project evaluating the latest ML-based network trace generators ([NetShare](https://github.com/netsharecmu/NetShare.git) and [STAN](https://github.com/ShengzheXu/stan.git)).

# Raw traces and synthetic traces

Raw traces are in `/data/raw` (including three dataset [UGR16](https://nesg.ugr.es/nesg-ugr16/), [CIDDS](https://www.hs-coburg.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte-oeffentlich/informationstechnologie/cidds-coburg-intrusion-detection-data-sets.html), [TON_IoT](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets)). 
Synthetic traces generated by NetShare are in `/data/netshare`.
Synthetic traces generated by STAN are in `/data/stan`.

# Evaluation

Evaluation of statistical properties are included in `port_numbers.ipynb` and `continious_fields.ipynb`.
Evaluation of temporal properties are included in `temporal_properties.ipynb`.
